# 🧮 GA_Odev – Genetic Algorithm Project

This repository contains a **C# implementation of Genetic Algorithms (GA)** developed in **Visual Studio**.  
The project demonstrates how **evolutionary computing techniques** can be applied to solve optimization problems by simulating the process of natural selection.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The project is built around the concept of **Genetic Algorithms**, which are inspired by the mechanisms of **natural selection, crossover, and mutation**.  
It provides an example of how GA can be applied in a programming environment to find near-optimal solutions for given problems.

Key learning objectives of this project:
- Understand the **basic workflow of Genetic Algorithms**  
- Implement GA operators such as **selection, crossover, and mutation**  
- Observe how solutions **evolve over iterations**  

---

## ✨ Features
- 👥 **Population-based approach**  
  Works with a group of potential solutions evolving together.  

- 🔄 **Crossover and Mutation**  
  Demonstrates how new candidate solutions are generated.  

- 📊 **Fitness Evaluation**  
  Calculates how close each candidate is to the optimal solution.  

- 🖥️ **C# Implementation**  
  Written in C# with a clean and modular codebase.
